## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java DSA world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

In this repository, we learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with Java, following the Striver A2Z playlist. Additionally, we solve questions from LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks (GFG), and Coding Ninja.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
